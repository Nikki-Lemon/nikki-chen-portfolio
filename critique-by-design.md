# Critique & Redesign: Drink & Dating

## Step one: the visualization

Include link to the original data visualization (or screenshot - make sure to correctly cite your sources, etc.).  
Include paragraph or two on why you selected this particular data visualization.  
For obvious reasons, the data visualization you select should come from a publicly accessible source.

## Step two: the critique

What the Original Does Well

The two hearts for the drinking percentage stood out to me. By looking at them I quickly understand that single USA adults drink more.

Although the sizing can be a bit out of proportion (the 72% area is smaller than the 65% area), it expresses the idea clearly and interestingly.

The visualization did well on completeness, intuitiveness, and aesthetics.

It includes all relevant data.

I can easily understand the information in the text and graphs.

It is visually interesting, especially the two hearts for the percentages.

What the Original Does Not Do Well

The visualization didn’t do well on usefulness.

It contains too much information, so I can’t grasp the point easily.

When I look at the bar graphs, I only see that men prefer beer and women prefer wine.

This single piece of information lacks context and is unrelated to the central story of “singles drinking more.”

Audience and Effectiveness

The primary audience is people who care about the relationship between drinking and dating — perhaps online daters who want to improve their dating experience or people who want to start dating.

I think it is effective in reaching the audience because it grasps their attention easily with the titles “Drink & Dating” and “The most popular drinks.”

However, for this audience the “Singles drink more” story may feel irrelevant, and the audience may also find the bar chart messy.

How I Would Improve It

I will focus on making more sense of the bar chart.

I will also try removing some information so that the visualization tells one story more effectively.

Unifying the colors may also help.

## Step three: Sketch a solution

Redesign Focus

The original graph has too much data and lacks focus.

I choose only to show the percentage of drinking daters and what alcoholic drinks each gender prefers.

I get rid of the data of the drinking US population and the percentage of daters who drink non-alcoholic drinks.

This also changes the story to:

a. a lot of daters drink, and  
b. beer is popular among men and wine is popular among women.

Color and Style Choices

I simplify the colors and use blue and pink for men and women.

The subtitle is changed to a grey footnote to reduce visual noise and keep the chart cleaner.

## Step four: Test the solution

Interviewee 1, online dater in mid 20’s: the major takeaway is clear but feels like a stereotype, in most dates people drink non-alcoholic drinks; the color is good

Interviewee 2, grad student at Carnegie Mellon University: bar charts may not be the most effective way, try dot plot with dots of 2 colors; most people like coffee; the redesign is more focused than the original version

## Step five: Final solution

Reframing the story to avoid stereotypes and reflect dating reality

I removed the “beer for him / wine for her” framing because it reinforces gender stereotypes and oversimplifies the original data.

Instead, I shifted the focus toward a more reliable and realistic insight: most people do not drink alcohol on their early dates, and both men and women show similar preferences for non-alcoholic drinks like coffee and tea.

2. Applying the dot plot suggestion and adopting a clean color design

I took the suggestion of using a dot plot, because it clearly compares men and women across each drink type and makes similarities and differences easy to see. I also went with the simplified color scheme, using pink for women and blue for men, which keeps the visual clean and intuitive.

window.addEventListener("message",function(a){
  if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){
    var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");
    for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])
      for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)
        if(r.contentWindow===a.source){
          var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";
          r.style.height=d
        }
  }
});
</script>
